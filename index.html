     <div class="quote">"Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence." -Helen Keller (I heavily doubt Helen actually said this. Have you heard video of her talking? I'm not sure she would be able to say that. I'm a total doubter.)</div>
      <div class="quote">BRANDON CASH APOLOGETIC UPDATE: I just watched a few videos of Helen Keller. Wow. What an inspiring and fantastic women. I used to be a doubter but she really is legit. I think it's very plausible that she would have said such an inspiring and motivation thing, and I'm sorry for ever doubting her - she's truly remarkable. Take this lesson as your biggest motivational quote today - Even someone like myself can make mistakes sometimes.</div>
